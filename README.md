# shopping_list
This repository contains a Flutter project for learning purposes.

The main purpose of this repository is to learn how to make code that can be built for mobile (Android) and desktop (Ubuntu).

The projected steps are:
  1. :x: Make a simple shopping list app that allows to add and remove items in a list;
  2. :x: Implement tests;
  3. :x: Persist locally on the device the items added and removed from the list;
  4. :x: Implement localization for PT_BR and EN_US;
  5. :x: Build a simple backend API separately, to manage and persist data on a server;
  6. :x: Consume the API;

As the steps will be completed :x: will be replaced by :heavy_check_mark:
